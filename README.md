Hello! Welcome to Caroline Ehler's documentation/tutorial I've compiled for the Software Everywhere project!
This tutorial is specific to Turbonomic.

## Installation
See below for complete tutorial.
## Usage
## Tutorial
To begin, you'll need to be sure to have all of these things installed on your machine:
-Docker
-Node.js

If you don't, follow these steps:
A. Download Homebrew: https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Homebrew/
Follow the Homebrew setup tutorial.

B. Download Homebrew's Node.js: https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Node.js/

C. Download Homebrew's Docker: https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Docker/
BUT I find this tutorial a little confusing. Here is what to do:
```bash
brew install cask
brew install --cask docker
```

:) Done

D. If you don't have an IDE, I'm going to be using VS Code, so be sure to download that too.
